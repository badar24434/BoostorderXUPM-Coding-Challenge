# Sales Prediction Competition

## Introduction
Our group participated in a coding challenge aimed at building a machine learning model to predict sales for the third year, using patterns from the previous two years of sales data. The challenge required us to consider key factors such as seasonality and trends, which could significantly impact the accuracy of sales predictions.

To collaborate efficiently, our group decided to use Google Colab as our primary development platform. Google Colab made it easy for us to share code and collaborate in real-time, enhancing our teamwork. It also offered integrated support for widely-used machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Pandas. From there, the cloud-based environment provided the necessary computational power to train and test our models where it will remove the constraints of relying on local hardware.

Throughout the project, we leveraged Colab's collaborative features to experiment with various machine learning techniques and feature engineering strategies. This platform facilitated our group discussions and troubleshooting, ensuring we could iteratively improve the model and work together effectively, even when not physically in the same location.

To enhance the robustness of our model, we integrated two additional datasets. This enabled us to evaluate the model's performance across various data inputs, ensuring its ability to generalize effectively and be relevant in different sales scenario. By incorporating these datasets, we aimed to validate our methodology and deliver a flexible solution that can be leveraged by other models.

Ultimately, our goal as a team was to create a robust, reproducible model capable of accurately forecasting future sales trends. We documented the entire process, from feature selection to model evaluation, ensuring that our approach was transparent and easy to follow.

## Problem Statement
In the fast-paced retail environment, accurate sales forecasting is vital for efficient inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic decision-making. This competition encourages data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts to develop reliable and scalable models that can effectively predict retail sales trends.

Our group was tasked with developing a model to predict sales for the third year by analyzing patterns from the first two years. The model needed to consider critical factors such as seasonality, trends, and other relevant influences affecting sales.

We were encouraged to apply various feature engineering techniques, experiment with different model architectures, and implement relevant evaluation metrics to ensure the model’s predictions were as accurate as possible. Our group worked collaboratively to optimize the solution, providing a reliable and well-documented approach to future sales forecasting.

The challenge required our group to create a machine learning model capable of forecasting sales for the third year based on historical data from the first two years. This involved handling various patterns, including seasonal effects, holidays, and market shifts. We needed to develop a model that accurately captured these trends and provided reliable predictions for future sales.

Our primary goal was to develop an accurate model that could forecast third-year sales based on the available data from the first two years. We aimed to incorporate relevant factors such as seasonality and trends to ensure reliable predictions. Instead of relying on specific evaluation metrics like R-squared, we chose to evaluate the model directly based on its output and predictive capability. We assessed the model’s effectiveness by examining how well it predicted sales compared to the actual results.
