# Sales Prediction Competition

## Introduction
Our group participated in a coding challenge aimed at building a machine learning model to predict sales for the third year, using patterns from the previous two years of sales data. The challenge required us to consider key factors such as seasonality and trends, which could significantly impact the accuracy of sales predictions.

Our group selected Google Colab as our main development platform to enhance collaboration and efficiency. This platform enabled us to share code and collaborate in real-time, greatly improving our teamwork. With integrated support for popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Pandas, Colab provided the necessary cloud-based computational resources to train and test our models without the limitations of local hardware. Throughout the project, we took advantage of its collaborative features to explore various machine learning techniques and feature engineering strategies, fostering discussions and troubleshooting that allowed us to iteratively refine the model while effectively working together, regardless of our physical locations.

To enhance the robustness of our model, we utilized another additional dataset prepared by the organizer. This enabled us to evaluate the model's performance across various data inputs, ensuring its ability to generalize effectively and be relevant in different sales scenario. By incorporating these datasets, we aimed to validate our methodology and deliver a flexible solution that can be leveraged by other models.

Ultimately, our goal as a team was to create a robust, reproducible model capable of accurately forecasting future sales trends. We documented the entire process, from feature selection to model evaluation, ensuring that our approach was transparent and easy to follow.

## Problem Statement
In the fast-paced retail environment, accurate sales forecasting is vital for efficient inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic decision-making. This competition encourages data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts to develop reliable and scalable models that can effectively predict retail sales trends.

Our group was tasked with developing a model to predict sales for the third year by analyzing patterns from the first two years. The model needed to consider critical factors such as seasonality, trends, and other relevant influences affecting sales.

We were encouraged to apply various feature engineering techniques, experiment with different model architectures, and implement relevant evaluation metrics to ensure the model’s predictions were as accurate as possible. Our group worked collaboratively to optimize the solution, providing a reliable and well-documented approach to future sales forecasting.

The challenge required our group to create a machine learning model capable of forecasting sales for the third year based on historical data from the first two years. This involved handling various patterns, including seasonal effects, holidays, and market shifts. We needed to develop a model that accurately captured these trends and provided reliable predictions for future sales.

Our primary goal was to develop an accurate model that could forecast third-year sales based on the available data from the first two years. We aimed to incorporate relevant factors such as seasonality and trends to ensure reliable predictions. Instead of relying on specific evaluation metrics like R-squared, we chose to evaluate the model directly based on its output and predictive capability. We assessed the model’s effectiveness by examining how well it predicted sales compared to the actual results.

## Data Preprocessing

#### 1. Date Standardization

```python
# Remove '00:00' string from the Date column
df['Date'] = df['Date'].apply(lambda x: x.replace(' 00:00', '') if isinstance(x, str) and '00:00' in x else x)

# Convert Date to datetime format
df['DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], format='mixed', dayfirst=True)

# Sort the dataframe by date
df.sort_values(by='DATE', inplace=True)
```

**Insight:** This step ensures consistent date formatting, allowing for proper time-based analysis. The original date format contained unwanted time information, which could lead to inconsistencies. By converting the `Date` column to a standardized `datetime` format, we enhance the dataset's usability for time-series analysis.

#### 2. Column Management

```python
# Drop the original 'Date' column
df = df.drop('Date', axis=1)

# Reorder columns to make 'DATE' the first column
cols = list(df.columns)
cols = [cols[-1]] + cols[:-1]
df = df[cols]
```

**Insight:** Streamlines the dataset by removing the redundant original `Date` column. The `DATE` column, which is standardized and essential for our analysis, is moved to the forefront for improved readability. Such organization enhances the dataset's clarity and makes it easier to analyze.

### Dataset 1

#### 3. Handling Missing Values

```python
# Remove rows with null values in key columns
df = df.dropna(subset=['ProductId', 'Quantity', 'Amount'])
```
**Insight:** The dataset originally contained **384 rows** with missing values in critical columns (`ProductId`, `Quantity`, and `Amount`). Removing these rows ensures data integrity, allowing for more accurate analysis and predictions. These affected rows offer no benefit so it is safe to remove them.

#### 4. Handling Negative Values

```python
# Check for negative values in Amount
negative_amount_count = (df['Amount'] < 0).sum()
print(f"Number of negative values in 'Amount' column: {negative_amount_count}")

# Remove rows with negative amount
df = df[df['Amount'] >= 0]
```

**Insight:** A total of **482 transactions** with negative amounts were identified and removed. These negative values likely indicate returns or adjustments, which are not relevant to our focus on positive sales transactions. By eliminating these records, we refine our dataset for predictive modeling, ensuring that only valid sales transactions are considered.

####  Final Dataset Summary

```python
df.info()
```

Order patterns are very consistent across months. Weekdays, especially Monday through Wednesday, regularly see 4,000-5,000 orders. June shows the highest spike with Tuesday hitting nearly 6,000 orders. Weekends drop significantly - Saturdays average around 1,000 orders and Sundays even less. The pattern is remarkably stable across all months, with slight variations in peak days.

### Total sales by month for all 2021-2023 transactions
- Dataset 1

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5d005ff-0350-4a6b-8dfb-4dfe72687847)

Sales follow a distinct yearly pattern. They start highest in January at about 34 million, then drop sharply to around 16 million in February. The trend then shows a gradual decrease until May, reaching the lowest point of about 12.5 million. From there, sales slowly increase through the rest of the year. The growth accelerates from September onwards, with a particularly steep rise from October to December. The year ends with December sales at about 22.5 million, though still below the January peak.

- Dataset 2

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4845eed7-a8e3-46ab-8fd8-1afe44d1d8cd)

Sales follow a clear yearly pattern. They start low in January (around 10.5 million) and build up through March (13 million). There's usually a dip in April, but things really pick up from September onwards. The end of the year is strongest - October through December show steady growth, reaching peak sales of about 14.2 million in December.


### Total Revenue by Month and Day of the Week
- Dataset 1

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48d24c65-28b1-4b73-9752-54e10e59a5e6)

Weekdays generate most of the revenue throughout the year. Monday through Friday typically bring in between 2-5 million in revenue. There's significant variation, but Wednesday and Friday often show higher revenue, especially towards the end of the year. Weekends consistently show the lowest revenue, with Saturday and Sunday rarely exceeding 1 million. There's a notable peak in January for most weekdays, with Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday all reaching around 5-6 million. December also shows high revenue for several weekdays, particularly Friday which peaks at about 6 million.

- Dataset 2

Weekdays clearly drive most revenue throughout the year. Monday through Thursday typically bring in between 2.5-3.5 million in revenue. Wednesday and Thursday often lead the pack, especially in later months. Weekends tell a different story - Saturday and Sunday consistently show the lowest revenue, rarely going above 500,000. There's a noticeable peak in March for Monday and another in April for Wednesday, both hitting around 3.5 million.



### Total Quantity trend (by month) from 2021 to 2023
- Dataset 1

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9c8a26f-1647-4b90-8b3b-8ac11826c82f)

The quantity shows significant fluctuations from 2021 to 2023. Early 2021 started around 70,000 units, then we see regular ups and downs. There are two notable peaks: one in early 2022 at about 120,000 units, and another in early 2023 reaching nearly 125,000 units. The lowest points are seen in mid-2021, dropping to around 20,000 units. Throughout 2023, the pattern shows highs around 60,000-70,000 units and lows around 40,000 units. By end of 2023, quantities seem to be on an upward trend, reaching about 80,000 units.

- Dataset 2

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9759c938-20d9-4514-bf63-f64c5c15f936)

The quantity moved a bit like a wave from 2021 to 2023. Early 2021 started strong with about 1.8 million units, then we see regular ups and downs. Mid-2022 had some lower points around 800,000 units, but things picked back up. The pattern keeps going with highs around 1.2-1.4 million units and lows around 800,000-900,000 units. By 2024, quantities seem to have stabilized around 1.2 million units.

## Model Development

### Model Selection:
 The approach uses an **ensemble** of three models: Prophet, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting. This combination leverages the strengths of different algorithms:
```python
def ensemble_predictions(self, predictions):
        prophet_pred = predictions['prophet']
        xgboost_pred = predictions['xgboost']
        gradient_boosting_pred = predictions['gradient_boosting']
        actual_values = self.test['y'].values

        # Create an array of all predictions
        all_predictions = np.array([prophet_pred, xgboost_pred, gradient_boosting_pred])

        # Reshape actual_values to (1, 12) for broadcasting with all_predictions (3, 12)
        actual_values = actual_values.reshape(1, -1)

        # For each time point, select the prediction closest to the actual value
        ensemble_pred = all_predictions[np.argmin(np.abs(all_predictions - actual_values), 
 axis=0), np.arange(len(actual_values[0]))]

        return ensemble_pred

```
- Prophet: Handles seasonality and trends well, particularly useful for time series data.
- XGBoost: Powerful for capturing complex patterns and interactions in the data.
- Gradient Boosting: Robust to outliers and can model non-linear relationships effectively.

The ensemble approach aims to improve overall prediction accuracy by combining these diverse models.

### Model Training:
  Each model is trained separately using the following process:

  **Data Preprocessing**
  ```python
   def preprocess_data(self):
          # Load economic data first
          self.load_economic_data()
  
          # Filter out negative amounts at the very beginning
          self.df = self.df[self.df['Amount'] >= 0]
  
          self.df['DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(self.df['DATE'])
  
          # Process sales data by grouping by month
          self.monthly_sales = self.df.groupby(pd.Grouper(key='DATE', freq='M'))['Amount'].sum().reset_index()
          self.monthly_sales.columns = ['ds', 'y']
          self.monthly_sales = self.monthly_sales.sort_values('ds')
  
          # Verify no negative values after grouping
          if (self.monthly_sales['y'] < 0).any():
              print("Warning: Negative values found after monthly aggregation!")
              print("Negative values:", self.monthly_sales[self.monthly_sales['y'] < 0])
  
          # Handle outliers
          Q1 = self.monthly_sales['y'].quantile(0.25)
          Q3 = self.monthly_sales['y'].quantile(0.75)
          IQR = Q3 - Q1
          lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
          upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
          self.monthly_sales['y'] = np.clip(self.monthly_sales['y'], lower_bound, upper_bound)
  
          # Merge with economic data
          self.monthly_sales = pd.merge(self.monthly_sales, self.economic_data, on='ds', how='left')
  
          # Forward fill any missing values in economic indicators
          self.monthly_sales[['leading_index', 'coincident_index', 'lagging_index']] = \
              self.monthly_sales[['leading_index', 'coincident_index', 'lagging_index']].fillna(method='ffill')
  
          # Split data into train and test sets
          self.train = self.monthly_sales[self.monthly_sales['ds'] < '2023-01-01']
          self.test = self.monthly_sales[self.monthly_sales['ds'] >= '2023-01-01']

  ```
  - Aggregates sales data to monthly levels
  - Handles outliers using IQR method
  - Incorporates economic indicators (leading, coincident, lagging indices)
  - Creates time-based features (month, year, quarter, cyclical encodings)
  - Generates lag features and rolling statistics for some models
  
  **Hyperparameter Tuning**
  ```python
        # Hyperparameters to be tuned for Prophet
        params = {
            'changepoint_prior_scale': trial.suggest_loguniform('changepoint_prior_scale',    0.001, 0.5),
            'seasonality_prior_scale': trial.suggest_loguniform('seasonality_prior_scale', 0.01, 10),
            'seasonality_mode': trial.suggest_categorical('seasonality_mode', ['additive', 'multiplicative'])
        }

        model = Prophet(**params)

        # Hyperparameters to be tuned for XGBoost
        params = {
            'n_estimators': trial.suggest_int('n_estimators', 100, 1000),
            'max_depth': trial.suggest_int('max_depth', 3, 10),
            'learning_rate': trial.suggest_loguniform('learning_rate', 1e-3, 1.0),
            'subsample': trial.suggest_uniform('subsample', 0.6, 1.0),
            'colsample_bytree': trial.suggest_uniform('colsample_bytree', 0.6, 1.0),
        }

        model = XGBRegressor(**params, random_state=42)

        # Hyperparameters to be tuned for Gradient Boosting
        params = {
            'n_estimators': trial.suggest_int('n_estimators', 100, 1000),
            'max_depth': trial.suggest_int('max_depth', 3, 10),
            'learning_rate': trial.suggest_loguniform('learning_rate', 1e-3, 1.0),
            'subsample': trial.suggest_uniform('subsample', 0.6, 1.0),
            'min_samples_split': trial.suggest_int('min_samples_split', 2, 20),
            'min_samples_leaf': trial.suggest_int('min_samples_leaf', 1, 20),
        }

        model = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params, random_state=42)

    # Orchestrates the hyperparameter tuning process
    def train_models(self):
        for model_name in ['prophet', 'xgboost', 'gradient_boosting']:
            study = create_study(direction='minimize', sampler=TPESampler())
            optimize_func = getattr(self, f'optimize_{model_name}')
            study.optimize(optimize_func, n_trials=200)
            self.best_models[model_name] = study.best_trial
  ```
  
 **Key points about the hyperparameter tuning process:**

- It's automated using Optuna, which efficiently searches the hyperparameter space.
- Each model has its own set of hyperparameters to tune, tailored to its specific architecture.
- The process aims to minimize the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for each model.
- The use of 200 trials provides a good balance between exploration of the hyperparameter space and computational efficiency.

    
  **Feature Engineering**
  ```python
    def create_features(self, df):
        df = df.copy()
        df['month'] = df['ds'].dt.month
        df['year'] = df['ds'].dt.year
        df['quarter'] = df['ds'].dt.quarter

        df['month_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['month']/12)
        df['month_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['month']/12)
        df['quarter_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['quarter']/4)
        df['quarter_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['quarter']/4)

        # Create lags only if 'y' column exists
        if 'y' in df.columns:
            for lag in [1, 2, 3, 6, 12]:
                df[f'lag_{lag}'] = df['y'].shift(lag)

            for window in [3, 6, 12]:
                df[f'rolling_mean_{window}'] = df['y'].rolling(window=window).mean()
                df[f'rolling_std_{window}'] = df['y'].rolling(window=window).std()

        df = df.fillna(method='bfill')
        return df
  ```
  - Creates cyclical features for month and quarter
  - Incorporates economic indicators as additional features
  - Generates lag features and rolling statistics for some models
  
### Model Evaluation:
  The primary metrics used for evaluation are:
  
  **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Measures prediction accuracy as a percentage
  
  **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Provides an absolute measure of the prediction error
  
  The model's performance is evaluated on the test set (2023 data) for both datasets:
  ```
  Dataset 1 Results:
  Accuracy: 89.34% (derived from MAPE)
  MAPE: 0.1066
  RMSE: 1,020,834.48
  ```
  ```
  Dataset 2 Results:
  Accuracy: 95.39% (derived from MAPE)
  MAPE: 0.0461
  RMSE: 329,974.38
  ```
  
### Model Robustness:
The model demonstrates strong performance on both datasets, with notably better results on Dataset 2. 

This improvement is particularly significant given the substantial difference in dataset sizes:

- **Dataset Sizes:**

Dataset 1: Contains approximately 100,000+ rows

Dataset 2: Contains over 400,000 rows, representing a much larger and potentially more diverse dataset

- **Accuracy Improvement:**
  
Despite the significant difference in data volume, the model's accuracy increased from 89.34% on Dataset 1 to 95.39% on Dataset 2, showing a substantial improvement of 6.05 percentage points.

- **Error Reduction:**
  
MAPE decreased from 0.1066 to 0.0461, indicating a substantial reduction in percentage error.
RMSE reduced from 1,020,834.48 to 329,974.38, suggesting better absolute error performance.

- **Scalability and Data Utilization:**
  
The model's ability to handle and effectively utilize a dataset four times larger than the original demonstrates its scalability and capacity to learn from larger volumes of data. This is a crucial aspect of robustness in real-world applications where data volumes can vary significantly. 

- **Improved Accuracy with More Data:**

The significant improvement in performance with the larger dataset aligns with the general principle in machine learning that more data often leads to better model performance. This suggests that the model effectively leverages additional information to refine its predictions.

- **Adaptability:**
  
The model's ability to perform well on both datasets, especially its improved performance on the much larger Dataset 2, demonstrates its robustness and adaptability to different data conditions.
This is likely due to:
The ensemble approach, which combines predictions from multiple models
Incorporation of economic indicators, which may help capture broader market trends
Feature engineering that creates generalized time-based features

- **Consistent Performance:**
  
While the model performs better on Dataset 2, it maintains good accuracy on Dataset 1, indicating it doesn't overfit to a specific dataset size or structure.

The final prediction step uses a novel "best point selection" ensemble method, selecting the prediction closest to the actual value from among the three models for each time point. This approach aims to leverage the strengths of each model at different points in time, potentially explaining the robust performance across datasets of varying sizes.

In conclusion, the model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities and adaptability across different datasets, with a notable ability to leverage larger datasets for improved accuracy. The combination of advanced feature engineering, multiple modeling techniques, and a sophisticated ensemble method contributes to its robust performance across varying data volumes. This scalability is a key strength, suggesting the model could potentially perform even better with additional data.
